💡 Power BI in Action: Super Store Sales Dashboard! 💡

Excited to share my latest project! 🎉 I developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard that provides real-time insights for an e-commerce store using Super Store Sales data. Here's what I’ve been working on:

- 📊 The dashboard is fully region-wise dynamic, allowing seamless interaction with all visualizations based on different regions.
- 📈 Leveraging Power BI’s forecasting capabilities, I created a 15-day sales forecast Line Chart on Page 2 to help anticipate future trends.
- 🛠️ Using DAX queries, I introduced a new column and table, optimizing data analysis further.
- ⏱️ The Avg. Delivery Days card on Page 1 calculates delivery time by utilizing the DATEDIFF function between the order date and the ship date.
