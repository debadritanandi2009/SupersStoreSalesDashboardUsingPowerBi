# SupersStoreSalesDashboardUsingPowerBi
Super Store Sales data is a csv files whichh contains the details of various Measures of an e-commerce store in terms of category,sub-category,segment,Region,Sales,Proift,Order-date-Ship-Date

Here with the help of Power Bi I have made a dashboard which is dynamic region-wise to all  the visualizations on the dashboard as per the regions. 
On page 2 with the help of forecasting methodology of Power BI , I have made the Line Chart for the Sales for the next 15 days.
Using Dax queries I have added in a new Col. and new Table too 
The card present on Page 1 of Avg. Delivery days is done by using Dax Query using DATEDIFF between the order date and the Ship Date.
